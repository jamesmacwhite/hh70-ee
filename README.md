# EE HH70VB Router (4GEE Home Router)

Unofficial technical documentation of the EE branded Alcatel HH70VB router. There is also a BT branded variant which for the most part, is the same product. The 4GEE Home Router is now no longer available from EE directly.

**Note:** This is the older variant preceeding the 4GEE Home Router 2.
